            <h5>This site was created by me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaeweiss/" target="_blank">Josh Weiss</a>. I was a teacher for 7 years and saw many types of classrooms -- public and private, domestic and international, high-income and low-income. For too many of those years, I was inept in applying the rich array of strategies out there. Aionno was born of his fascination with finding and applying better strategies day-by-day, year-by-year. </h5><br>
            <h5>This site intends improve teachers' aresnal of techniques, methods, and interventions that make learning stick. Think of Aionno like a master teacher in the break room learning in and whispering, "Tell me again where the lesson went wrong. I think I may have a fix."  </h5><br>
            <h5>
               Aionno is still in the toddler phase, so please be patient as it grows and knocks into furniture. But feedback is lovely! Do you know a strategy that we can add to the site? Do you want to integrate this tool into a training or professional development curriculum? Feel free to get in touch  <a href="mailto:jweiss55@gmail.com" target="_blank">here</a>.   </h5>
